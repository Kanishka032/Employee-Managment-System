It seems like you'd like to include an image in the README file, but you provided a local file path from your computer (C:\Users\Personal\Pictures\Saved Pictures\Screenshots). Unfortunately, the image cannot be directly linked from your local machine.

To include an image in the `README.md`, you will need to either:

1. **Upload the image to a public image hosting service** (like Imgur or GitHub itself) and use the URL to display the image.
2. **Place the image in your project repository** and use a relative path to reference it.

### Example 1: Using a hosted image (from an external URL)
```markdown
![Employee Management System](https://path.to.your.image.jpg)
```

### Example 2: Using a local image from your project folder

1. Move the image into a folder in your project (e.g., `assets/images`).
2. Reference the image using the relative path:
```markdown
![Employee Management System](assets/images/your-image.jpg)
```
